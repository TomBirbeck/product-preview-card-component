## My process

Intially I reset the margins and padding on the page to 0 and set the box-sizing to be border-box.
I then built out a HTML framework for the page and added the content.
I styled the page to fit the mobile design and then added media queries to get the design for the desktop.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was a good challenge for working with media queries to change the layout of the page depending on the screen size.
